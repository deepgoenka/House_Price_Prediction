# House Price Prediction System

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset containing various attributes related to real estate properties. Linear Regression is employed for regression tasks. It is giving an impressive R-squared score of 0.9996 making it perfect for predictions.

## Accuracy
- Linear Regression: R-squared score of 0.9996

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of real estate properties in the USA, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc. These attributes are crucial for training and evaluating the performance of the prediction models.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on the R-squared score, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (house prices) that is predictable from the independent variables (property attributes). A higher R-squared score indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

## Conclusion
The Linear Regression algorithm emerges as the most effective model in predicting house prices, achieving an outstanding R-squared score of 0.9996. The robust performance of the model suggests its potential applicability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights for both homebuyers and sellers in the USA real estate market.
